reduce in javascript                                     |          useReducer in React
arrys.reduce(reducer,initial value)                      |  useReducer(reducer,initialState)
singlevalue=reducer(accumulator,itemValue)               |  newState=reducer(currentstate,action)
reduce methds returns a single value                     |  useReducer returns a pair of values =>  {newState,dispatch}
